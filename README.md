# zulip-walkbot

A bot for the walking group at @recursecenter.

## Usage

Currently when the words "walkbot" are said with any sort of capitalization, in any Recurse Center Zulip thread, WalkBot will respond with a message describing the weather and the pridicted weather for the next hour.

## Deployment

Heroku autopushes from the master branch of this repo. The heroku project is `walk-bot` and owned by `Nat Welch (SP2'15)`. Ping him if you would like access to the bot or if something is wrong.

# Future changes

This is a list of suggested projects:

 - Add auto walk announcements
 - Create suggested walks
 - Look at all weather for the day and suggest a good walk time if it will be a bad time at 1500.
